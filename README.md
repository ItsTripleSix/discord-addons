## ShiggyCord plugins

The ShiggyCord collection has **7 released plugins**. Theme Toolkit remains separate and has not been ported to ShiggyCord.

### Account Switcher

Restores Discord's native-style mobile multi-account switching.

- Uses Discord's existing saved-account state rather than storing or exporting account tokens itself.
- Keeps Android push registration focused on the active account.
- Uses native notification handling.
- Includes persisted plugin settings.

### Composer Cleaner

Cleans up the message composer without removing third-party composer plugins.

- Individually hide attachments, gifts, emoji, microphone/voice, apps/commands, and new-thread controls.
- Changes are configurable from plugin settings.
- Targets native Discord composer controls only.

### Hidden Channels

Makes inaccessible channels easier to understand when Discord has already sent their metadata to the client.

- Shows hidden/inaccessible channel entries that are already present locally.
- Restores channel names from available metadata.
- Does not grant message access or bypass server permissions.
- Does not load inaccessible channel messages.

### Purge Tools

Bulk cleanup for messages and reactions across selected DMs, channels, and servers.

- Per-target author, reaction, filter, and deletion-order controls.
- Preview/discovery before destructive cleanup.
- Reusable preview snapshots so a confirmed purge can skip repeating initial discovery.
- Message deletion and reaction cleanup with permission checks for moderator actions.
- Media/attachment protection controls.
- Pause, resume, interruption checkpoints, and optional automatic resume.
- Conservative shared request pacing that adapts to Discord feedback.
- Transient server-error retries with recovered/unresolved failure accounting.
- Verification passes and readable progress/status reporting.

### Quick Mock

Fast alternating-case mock text.

- `/mock` command workflow.
- Reply-to-mock workflow.
- Long-press message action.
- Configurable long-press behavior.

### Settings Pins

Puts frequently used plugin settings directly into the main ShiggyCord settings section.

- Pin installed plugin settings with per-plugin saved toggles.
- Hide non-core plugin shortcuts that were already registered in ShiggyCord, including bundled/hard-baked entries.
- Core ShiggyCord settings remain protected from hiding.
- Pin and visibility choices persist.
- After changing a pin or existing shortcut, use **ReShiggy** for the main Settings list to rebuild.

### Silent Typing

Adds an Aliucord-style silent-typing control to the message composer.

- Toggle silent typing directly from chat input.
- Suppresses Discord's typing event while enabled.
- Customizable behavior through plugin settings.

## Purge Tools account-risk notice

> **Personally, Purge Tools has worked fine for me. Discord can still restrict or ban accounts for activity it considers abusive or automated. Use it at your own risk. I am not responsible for account restrictions, suspensions, or bans.**

This notice applies to both the ShiggyCord and Revenge Classic builds.
